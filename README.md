# 3D Visualization Plotter

A small side project for visualizing data in 3D space

I wasn't a fan of the clunky Geogebra 3D tool that the workbook for **MATH 363: Differential Equations** uses, so I built my own.

## Running Locally
You can run the project locally without a backend server by using Python's built-in HTTP server:

```
cd server-less
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then, open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

## Running on the Web
You can access the 3D Visualizer online here:
