# 3D Visualization Plotter

Final project for MATH 363: Differential Equations

I wasn't a fan of the clunky Geogebra 3D tool that the workbook for **MATH 363: Differential Equations** uses, so I built my own.

## Running Locally
You can manually run the python file main.py and enter requested information in the terminal

## Running local Python Server
If you don't want to run the python code but run the website via your own computer, do ```cd server-less``` ```python -m http.server 8000``` then go
to **[localhost](http://localhost:8000/)**

## Running on the Web
You can access the 3D Visualizer online here:
