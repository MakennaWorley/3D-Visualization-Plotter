# 3D Visualization Plotter

A small side project for visualizing data in the 3d space

I didn't like the clunky Geogebra 3D tool that the workbook for MATH 363 Differential Equations uses, so I made my own.

Hopefully I'll get this on the web or as some package to run locally on any machine but until then you have to make the
project on your device and have python and any of the packages I use installed.
